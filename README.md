# Save your Signature on IPFS!

This a simple template to save your signature on IPFS.

On `Signature.vue` you have to paste your own Pinata token.

**:warning: README**: it is not a good practice to store your PRIVATE token on files like this. This is only for demonstration 
purposes. Protect your secrets and don't commit them to public places :lock: .
